## Background

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset(provided), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Visualization

Use D3 library to read in the provided data, samples.json. With this data a horizontal barchart with a dropdown menu was rendered to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual. The drop down menu allows you to select a subject ID and display all relevant data for that ID

A bubble chart was rendered to produce another helpful visualization for the metadata. The OTU ID is assigned to the x axis and the sample values are assigned to the y axis. Sample Values was also assigned to marker size to be able to easily discern the data point's relative value

## HTML

An 'index.html' file was used to produce the dashboard space for the visualization content that was created. This index.html file is being hosted through a github repository in order to make it accesible. Github link: https://github.com/NCSUducker/plotly.github.io
